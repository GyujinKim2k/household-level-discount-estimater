# Simulator Specification — Household-Level NPE Project

**Status:** DRAFT — not yet frozen.
**Phase:** Phase 3 (two-asset, credit cards, present bias). Port **validated**
against Laibson et al.'s published simulation (§7.1).
**Last updated:** 2026-09-02.

This document specifies the lifecycle consumption-saving simulator used to
generate training data for the household-level NPE. It must be **frozen
(timestamped via a tagged git commit)** before any PSID empirical work begins.

Two simulators exist in the tree. **Phase 3 is the `twoasset` simulator** and is
what this spec describes. The Phase 1–2 HARK MVP (`hark`) is retained only so
those results stay reproducible; §§1–5 below describe the Phase 3 model, and
the Phase 1–2 model is summarised in §9.

## 1. Model overview

Phase 3: **two-asset lifecycle consumption-saving with credit cards and naive
quasi-hyperbolic discounting**, ported from Laibson, Maxted, Repetto and
Tobacman's replication package (`replication-package-LLMRT/`). Annual
frequency, ages 20–90 (`T = 71`).

Per period the household holds liquid assets `X` and illiquid assets `Z`, and
chooses next-period `(X', Z')` jointly:

- `X` may go **negative** down to an age-varying credit limit, borrowed at
  `R_CC`; positive balances earn `R`. This is the credit-card margin.
- `Z ≥ 0` earns `R_gamma > R`, but withdrawals pay a proportional, age-varying
  liquidation penalty. Its return is received as a consumable flow
  `(R_gamma − 1)·Z`.
- Utility is CRRA over consumption scaled by effective household size.
- A bequest motive with weight `alpha` values the annuitized estate.

The illiquid asset is what makes present bias identifiable: a present-biased
household simultaneously borrows expensively on `X` and holds illiquid `Z`, a
combination an exponential household would not choose.

Only their **baseline** configuration is ported. Skipped robustness branches:
`sqrtscale`, `mortalityn`, `split_income_at_retirement`,
`income_var_multiplier`, `income_auto9`, `zilliq`, the `R_gamma_expectation`
perceived-return case, and the sophisticated (`betahat = beta`) agent.

## 2. Parameters

### 2.1 Structural parameters (estimated)
- **β** — present-bias parameter. **Unlocked in Phase 3** (locked at 1 for
  Phases 1–2).
- **δ** — long-run discount factor.
- **ρ** (`crra` in code) — coefficient of relative risk aversion.

Ordering is `(β, δ, ρ)`, matching their `prefs` vector. `PriorBox.names`
returns this order and it is load-bearing for the posterior's column meaning.

**Naive, not sophisticated.** `betahat = 1`: the current self acts on `β·δ` but
believes every future self will discount exponentially. Backward induction
therefore takes **two** argmaxes per state — one at `β·δ` giving the simulated
policy, one at `betahat·δ` giving the value propagated to the previous self.
This matches their benchmark (`naif = 1`, `betahat = 1`).

### 2.2 Calibrated parameters
All first-stage values are theirs, education group **`comphs`** (completed high
school — their benchmark, `EDFbatch_baseline.m:22`). They are **frozen as
literals** in `src/hh_npe/simulator/laibson_calibration.py` so the 653 MB
replication package is not a runtime dependency;
`python -m hh_npe.simulator.laibson_calibration` re-extracts all 126 values
from the package and asserts bit-exact equality.

| Group | Source | Values |
|---|---|---|
| Demographics (kids, dependent adults) | IPUMS-USA | 6 coefficients |
| Income profile (age cubic, spouse, kids, dependents) | PSID | 7 coefficients |
| Income AR(1) + transitory | PSID | `psi = 0.8400`, `vareps = 0.05708`, `varnu = 0.04509` |
| Credit limit (quadratic in age, as a multiple of mean income) | SCF | 3 coefficients |
| Initial wealth (median wealth-to-income) | SCF | total `1.4696`, liquid `0.05486` |
| Mortality | SSA TR2023 historical, M/F average over 2000–2004 | 71 annual death probabilities |

Returns (their `benchmark` case): `R = 1.0203`, `R_gamma = 1.0500`,
`R_CC = 1.1059`. Bequest weight `alpha = 0.5`. Persistent income states
`nS = 3`, Tauchen span `m = 1.5`.

**Deviation from Phases 1–2:** mortality is now their SSA TR2023 schedule, not
HARK's bundled SSA 2020 period life table. The two simulators are calibrated to
different sources by design — the Phase 3 model is a replication target.

### 2.3 Prior on structural parameters (Phase 3 NPE training)
- `beta`  ~ Uniform[**0.30, 1.00**]
- `delta` ~ Uniform[**0.85, 1.00**]
- `crra`  ~ Uniform[**0.5, 5.0**]

All three of their benchmark estimates (β=0.5305, δ=0.9891, ρ=1.9355) fall
inside this box, as do the exponential-restriction estimates (δ=0.9600,
ρ=1.4663). `delta < 1` is required — the bequest term divides by `1 − δ`.

**Sampling**: scrambled Sobol sequence (`scipy.stats.qmc.Sobol`); the companion
sbi `BoxUniform` provides the log-density used during NPE training. Prefer
power-of-2 sample sizes.

## 3. Income process

Log income has a deterministic age/demographic profile plus a persistent AR(1)
component and an iid transitory shock:

- **Profile** `ymean_(age)`: cubic in age plus spouse, kids and dependent-adult
  terms, with household composition itself an exponential-quadratic function of
  age (§2.2).
- **Persistent**: AR(1) with `psi = 0.8400`, discretized to `nS = 3` states by
  **Tauchen (1986)** on a grid spanning `±1.5` unconditional standard
  deviations. Ported from their `discretizeAR1`.
- **Transitory**: iid lognormal, discretized onto the *liquid-grid lattice in
  levels* so realized income always lands on a representable cash-on-hand
  shift, with middle-Riemann-sum width weighting. Ported from their
  `discretizeIID`.

**Deviation from Phases 1–2, deliberate:** Phases 1–2 used Rouwenhorst, which
§3 of the earlier spec preferred on the grounds that it dominates Tauchen at
high persistence. At `nS = 3` the discretization choice materially changes the
income process, and Phase 3's purpose is comparison against their published
estimates, so fidelity to their method wins. Their `psi = 0.84` is only
moderately persistent, so Rouwenhorst's advantage does not apply here anyway.

Naming note: Laibson uses ρ for CRRA risk aversion; AR(1) persistence is also
conventionally written ρ. In code we use `crra` for the structural parameter
and `psi`/`YWORK_AUTO` for income persistence.

## 4. Solution method

Brute-force discrete dynamic programming — no first-order conditions, no
policy interpolation, matching their approach. For every state `(X, Z, S)` at
every age, the joint argmax is taken over all `(X', Z')` grid pairs.

Grids (`src/hh_npe/simulator/grids.py`) reproduce theirs exactly at default
granularity: **nX = 190, nZ = 84**. The liquid grid is uniform at `xjump` below
zero and coarsens geometrically above it; the illiquid grid coarsens
geometrically from zero.

**One structural deviation, for vectorization.** They store a *separate* liquid
grid per age because the credit limit varies with age. We build a single grid
wide enough for the largest limit over the lifecycle and carry a per-age
feasibility mask. Since the negative segment is uniform at `xjump` and every
limit is rounded to that lattice, each age's grid is an **exact subset** of the
common grid — no interpolation, no approximation. This is asserted in
`tests/test_twoasset.py::test_credit_limit_is_on_the_grid`.

**Correctness gate.** Their dynamic budget identity
(`LifecycleSim_BackwardInduct.m:169`, `assert(abs(check) < 1e-5)`) is
re-derived independently from the stored policy indices and checked over the
**entire** grid, not a sample, in float64. In float32 the identity holds to
~1e-9 relative, which is ample for an argmax; both are tested.

**Unsolvable states.** Some states satisfy the credit limit but admit no
affordable action (maximum debt, no illiquid buffer, near the terminal age).
Their code lets `max` return an arbitrary index there. We expose a `solvable`
mask instead, and assert the forward pass never reaches such a state.

**Floating-point precision is a modeling requirement, not an implementation
detail.** The utility gap between adjacent liquid-grid points is
`(C/hhs)^(−ρ)·xjump ≈ 1.1e−5` at typical consumption, while the continuation
value accumulates over 71 periods to `|EV| ≈ 1e2`. float32's resolution at that
magnitude is `1.5e−5` — *larger than the gap the argmax must resolve*. Running
the DP in float32 therefore selects quantization noise, and because ties break
toward the lowest liquid index it does so with a systematic bias: it inflated
simulated credit-card borrowing by roughly 50% and drove the MSM objective from
70.6 to 352.2.

Two mitigations, both required:
1. `solve` runs in **float64 by default** (`ModelSpec.dtype`). Their MATLAB is
   double precision throughout, so this matches them.
2. `_age_step` **centres `EV`** before it enters the large tensor. `argmax` is
   invariant to adding a constant, so this is exact, and it recovers most of the
   lost headroom — centred float32 tracks float64 to within ~5% on the target
   moments, versus a ~50% error uncentred.

float32 remains selectable for quick iteration but must **never** be used for a
dataset or a validation run.

**Grid snapping ties round up.** Income realizations land on the `xjump`
lattice by construction (§3), but the liquid grid coarsens to 2000/4000/6000
above \$50k, so **26.9%** of cash-on-hand queries at the full grid fall exactly
midway between two grid points. `_nearest_index` resolves these to the *higher*
index, matching MATLAB's `griddedInterpolant(..., 'nearest')`. Rounding down
instead discards up to \$6,000 of liquid wealth per snap — only for wealthier
households, compounding with age, and in the expectation step as well as the
forward pass. It inflated simulated credit-card borrowing by ~10%.

**Grid coarsening.** NPE needs 10³–10⁵ solves, so dataset generation coarsens
the grids. Coarsening is an approximation and its cost is *measured*, not
assumed — `scripts/validate_twoasset.py`:

| Grid | solve | max \|diff\|/se vs full | median relative |
|---|---|---|---|
| coarse 81×46 | 72 s | 3.15 | 5.4% |
| **mid 107×56** | **234 s** | **0.94** | **2.2%** |
| full 190×84 (theirs) | 1678 s | — | — |

Phase 3 dataset generation uses the **mid** grid, which sits under one standard
error of discretization error. The full grid remains the reference for
validation runs.

## 5. Forward simulation

`twoasset.simulate` ports their `LifecycleSim_ForwardIter.m`. Households are
seeded at the SCF median liquid/illiquid wealth-to-income ratios at age 20 and
followed for the full lifecycle. Returned panel arrays, shape
`(n_households, T)`:

`income`, `consumption` (including the illiquid dividend), `liquid_assets`
(their `simL = simX − simY`, the position *before* income arrives, negative =
credit-card debt), `illiquid_assets`, `cash_on_hand`, `income_state`, `t_age`.

**No mortality in the forward pass.** This is their design, not an omission:
death enters only through the backward induction and through the survival
weights used when averaging moments. No household is ever replaced, so the
rebirth filter of §6.3 is a no-op for Phase 3 and retains 100% of draws. The
filter is kept because the Phase 1–2 HARK path does replace dead agents.

## 6. Annual → observation-wave aggregation rule

NPE inputs are fixed-length trajectories of `n_waves` observation waves, each
spanning `wave_years` annual simulator periods. The rule is itself a
pre-registered modeling choice and is fixed as follows. Implemented in
`src/hh_npe/data/waves.py`.

### 6.1 Window definition
With `age_start_sim = 20` (§2.2) and a first-wave age `start_age`, wave `w`
(0-indexed) spans annual indices `[t_start + wave_years·w, t_start +
wave_years·(w+1))` where `t_start = start_age - age_start_sim`. A window
extending past the simulator's final period raises `ValueError` rather than
truncating.

All phases pin `wave_years = 2`. Phases 1–2 pin `start_age = 30` and
`n_waves = 5` → ages 30–39.

**Phase 3 draws the start age at random** and cuts **8 windows per simulated
panel** (changed 2026-08-22, while this spec is still DRAFT and therefore
unfrozen). The current setting is `n_waves = 7` with start age from `U{25..46}`
— see §6.1.2 for how that was decided and §6.1.3 for why a single trained flow
is not enough. `start_age_high` is paired with `n_waves` so the age envelope
stays 25–59; it is not independently tunable.

### 6.1.1 Why the window is random

A fixed ages-30–49 window assumes every observed household is the same age.
PSID contains households at whatever ages they happened to be during the survey
years, and requiring a balanced ages-30–49 panel collapses the eligible birth
cohorts — the constraint recorded below. Randomizing the window removes that
requirement entirely: a household observed at 27–46 is now in-distribution.

Measured on 8192 training panels with 2816 held out, held-out `log q`:

| training windows | age channel | on random-age | on fixed-30 |
|---|---|---|---|
| fixed start 30, 1/panel | no | 1.649 | 3.657 |
| random `U{25..40}`, 1/panel | yes | 3.572 | 3.499 |
| random `U{25..40}`, 8/panel | yes | **4.219** | **4.182** |

Randomization recovers 1.92 of the 2.0 nats the fixed model loses on realistic
data, for 0.16 nats at its own design point. Augmentation adds ~0.65 more on
both, and the augmented model beats the fixed specialist even on fixed-30 data.

The household's age is supplied as a **per-wave age channel** (a fifth feature,
`FEATURES_TWOASSET_AGE`), derived from `t_age`, which every shard already
stores. PSID always records the head's age, so the posterior conditions on it
rather than marginalizing over it.

**A warning this comparison produced.** On random-age data the fixed model was
*sharper* than the randomized one — `beta` contraction 0.539 against 0.445 —
while being much less accurate (correlation with truth 0.492 against 0.650).
Contraction alone would have selected the mis-specified model. Every
contraction figure in this document is reported with an accuracy figure beside
it for that reason, and `scripts/compare_windows.py` reports SBC calibration
alongside both.

**Effective sample size is the panel count, not the window count.** 8 windows
from one panel are correlated draws from the joint
`theta ~ prior, panel ~ p(.|theta), s ~ U{25..40}, x = window(panel, s)`. They
are valid, and NPE stays consistent, but they carry no additional information
about `theta` — they teach the age mapping. Training splits by panel
(`hh_npe.npe.train._use_grouped_split`) because a row-wise split would validate
on households the model trained on.

### 6.1.2 Wave count — settled 2026-09-02 at `n_waves = 7`

**`n_waves = 7`, `wave_years = 2`, start age drawn from `U{25..46}`.** Windows
span 14 years and lie inside ages 25–59.

This is the third answer to this question. The first two were wrong, and both
failed the same way, so the method matters more than the number.

| date | claim | status |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-31 | 10 waves — "the only arm whose ranks are uniform on all three" | **retracted** |
| 2026-08-31 | 7 waves fails SBC; PSID cannot support the model | **retracted** |
| 2026-09-02 | 7 waves, `k=8`, 5-member ensemble | current |

**The error.** Each arm was trained once and judged on one KS p-value per
parameter. Under the null of perfect calibration a KS p-value is `Uniform(0,1)`
*by construction*, so a single draw is a maximally noisy statistic. Training 7
waves five times — holding the dataset, the panel split and the 1000 SBC draws
fixed, varying only network initialisation — moved the p-values over two to
three orders of magnitude: seed 1 passed all three parameters, seed 2 failed
all three. The published "10 waves is the only arm that passes" was a statement
about which seed 10 waves happened to draw.

A Bonferroni correction was offered as robustness at the time and did not help:
it controls multiplicity while leaving single-draw variance untouched, and
invoking it to *accept* a null makes the test weaker, not the conclusion safer.

**The rule that replaces it.** Decide on **coverage**, whose spread across
seeds is 0.004–0.012. Report the per-seed KS pass rate beside it as a secondary,
replication-aware figure. Never decide on a lone `ks_p`.

**Age envelopes must be matched.** Every arm previously started in `U{25..40}`,
so a longer window also reached older ages — length was confounded with depth
into life, which is the same defect already flagged against the 15-wave arm and
which went unnoticed through the entire 5/6/7/8/9/10/15 comparison. Both
surviving arms now occupy ages 25–59 exactly:

```
10 waves (20 yrs): start U{25..40} -> ends 44-59
 7 waves (14 yrs): start U{25..46} -> ends 38-59
```

`window.start_age_high` is therefore **paired with `n_waves`**:
`high = 59 - 2·n_waves + 1`. The start distributions still differ (16 vs 22
choices), which is unavoidable at different lengths; the envelope is the
confound that matters, because it carries the retirement crossing and the
mortality-free forward pass (§4).

**Replicated result.** 5 training seeds per arm, 57,344 panels, `k=8`, 2048
held-out draws, 1000 shared SBC draws, ensembled per §6.1.3:

| | 7 waves | 10 waves |
|---|---|---|
| held-out log q (ensemble) | 5.007 | **5.446** |
| coverage `beta` | 0.916 | 0.925 |
| coverage `delta` | **0.902** | 0.904 |
| coverage `crra` | **0.905** | 0.908 |
| KS, all three | pass | pass |

**Ten waves is genuinely sharper — 0.44 nats, stable across seeds — and both
are calibrated once ensembled.** The wave count is not chosen on calibration,
because calibration no longer discriminates. It is chosen on what PSID can
supply: credit-card debt is separable only from 2011, giving exactly seven
biennial waves (`PSID_DATA.md`). Seven costs 0.44 nats and keeps calibration.

If a data source offering ten clean waves appears, ten is the better window and
`start_age_high` moves to 40 with it.

**On the earlier single-model numbers.** Every pre-ensemble figure in this
document's history showed coverage near 0.87 against a nominal 0.90. That is
real and reproducible, and it is a property of a *single* flow, not of the wave
count — see §6.1.3. Do not quote single-model calibration as the model's.

### 6.1.3 Ensembling is required, not an optimization

A single trained flow is miscalibrated. Across five seeds at 7 waves, coverage
sits at 0.881 / 0.878 / 0.873 against a nominal 0.900, with seed standard
deviations of 0.004–0.012 — the ~0.03 shortfall is far outside noise. Credible
intervals from one flow are systematically too narrow.

The cause is approximation **variance**. Less informative data cannot produce
miscalibration: it produces a *wider* true posterior, and a correctly
approximated wide posterior still passes SBC. Non-uniform ranks mean
`q(θ|x) ≠ p(θ|x)`. The seed experiment localises it — with data, split and SBC
draws all fixed, each fitted flow lands somewhere different and each is
overconfident about its own landing spot.

**The remedy is a uniform mixture of 5 independently initialised models**
(sbi `EnsemblePosterior`), which is what variance calls for:

| | mean of 5 | best of 5 | ensemble |
|---|---|---|---|
| held-out log q | 4.763 | 4.772 | **5.007** |
| coverage `beta` | 0.881 | 0.894 | 0.916 |
| coverage `delta` | 0.878 | 0.881 | **0.902** |
| coverage `crra` | 0.873 | 0.890 | **0.905** |

It beats the *best* member by 0.24 nats, not merely the average, and every KS
test passes. The effect is robust to augmentation — it holds at `k` = 5, 8 and
10 alike.

Augmentation is **not** an alternative remedy. `k` adds correlated windows from
the same 57,344 panels and carries no information about `θ` (§6.1.1); measured
coverage is flat in `k` (0.866–0.888 at every level), exactly as that predicts.
`k = 8` is chosen on `log q`, where it saturates: `k=10` ties at 5.007 for 25%
more rows and `k=5` costs 0.19 nats.

**Unresolved.** The correction slightly overshoots on `beta` — 0.916 against
0.900, about 1.7 SE at `n_sbc = 1000`, and smaller at `k=5` (0.907).
Overcoverage is the conservative direction and far milder than the
undercoverage it replaced, but it is not established either way: only one
ensemble per cell was measured, and separating it from noise needs several
independent ensembles (25 training runs per cell). Do not tune it away on a
single measurement — that is the error this section exists to prevent.

`wave_years = 1` (annual) is implemented and tested but is **not** the
pre-registered choice. It was considered for Phase 3 on the grounds that
Laibson et al.'s own moments are annual, and rejected: PSID has been biennial
since 1997, and Phase 4's empirical target is PSID. The simulator runs at
annual frequency internally either way (§2.2); only the observation window
differs, and it must match the data the posterior will eventually be applied
to.

### 6.2 Aggregation by variable type
- **Flows** (`income`, `consumption`) — **summed** over the annual periods in
  the window. With `wave_years = 1` this is the single year's value.
- **Stocks** (`liquid_assets`) — value at the **end of the final year** of the
  window.

Feature order is load-bearing — the embedder's input dimension is positional.
Two sets are defined in `src/hh_npe/data/waves.py`:

| Set | Features | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `FEATURES_MVP` | income, consumption, liquid_assets | Phases 1–2 (`hark`) |
| `FEATURES_TWOASSET` | income, consumption, liquid_assets, **illiquid_assets** | Phase 3 (`twoasset`) |

Phase 3 observes the illiquid balance because **eight of Laibson et al.'s
sixteen target moments are wealth conditional on debt status** (§7). Dropping
`illiquid_assets` would discard exactly the signal present bias rides on, since
the identifying pattern is expensive borrowing held *simultaneously* with
illiquid wealth. Output is `(n_households, n_waves, len(features))`, `float32`.

`income` and `consumption` are flows (summed); every other feature is a stock
(read at the end of the window).

### 6.3 Rebirth (single-lineage) filter
HARK replaces dead agents with newborns (§5), so a raw window can splice two
different households together. `aggregate_waves` returns an `alive` mask that
is False for any wave in which `t_age` is not monotonically non-decreasing
across the window **or across the boundary from the immediately preceding
annual period**. Dataset generation keeps only households with `alive` True at
every wave; at the Phase 2 pilot this retained 8,092 of 8,192 draws (98.8%).

## 7. Validation targets

### 7.1 Port fidelity (Phase 3 gate — **passed**)

At their exact 190×84 grid and their published benchmark estimates
(β=0.5305, δ=0.9891, ρ=1.9355), our 16 simulated moments match their stored
`MSMout.optMoments` to **mean |log(ours/theirs)| = 0.0102**, every moment
within 4%. MSM objective q = 85.3 against their 77.2, the gap being Monte Carlo
noise at `pop = 10000` under independent RNG streams.

Comparison is against **their simulated moments**, not the data. Comparing to
the data conflates port error with their model's own misfit — their objective
at the optimum is 77.2, so a perfect port still sits far from the data. The
moment code is separately verified by applying it to their own stored panel,
which reproduces all 16 of their values exactly.

- Reproduce HARK / Carroll buffer-stock standard lifecycle profiles
  (income / consumption / wealth means by age). **Phase 1 gate.**
- Laibson et al. comparison. Their MSM estimates, read from the replication
  package (`LifecycleSimulation/output/simulations/table3/EDFbatch_table3*.mat`,
  `MSMout.optprefs` and `MSMout.optprefs_stderr.full`):

  | Specification | β | δ | ρ | q |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | Benchmark (naive quasi-hyperbolic) | 0.5305 (0.114) | 0.9891 (0.0051) | 1.9355 (0.435) | 77.2 |
  | Exponential restriction (β ≡ 1) | 1 (imposed) | 0.9600 (0.0053) | 1.4663 (0.226) | 759.6 |

  **The exponential row is the comparable one for Phases 1–2**, which lock β=1
  (§2.1) and expose no β parameter at all. Both δ=0.9600 and ρ=1.4663 fall
  inside the Phase 2 prior box (§2.3), so the pilot posterior can be checked
  against them directly.

  Note that this is a **parameter-level** comparison only. Their target moments
  (%Visa, meanVisa, wealth | debt, wealth | no debt) are credit-card moments,
  and the Phase 1 MVP has no credit cards (`BoroCnstArt = 0`, §2.2). A
  moment-level replication is therefore **deferred to Phase 3**, when credit
  cards and the illiquid asset enter.

  Supersedes the earlier target of θ̂ ≈ (β=0.50, δ=0.99, ρ=1.3) recorded
  2026-05-24; the ρ value there was wrong by ~1.5 SE and the β value is not
  representable in a Phase 1–2 model.

## 8. Pre-registration commitments

- The simulator specified here is frozen at tag `simulator-v1` before any
  PSID data is loaded.
- Deviations from this spec require a new tagged version and a documented
  reason. The current document is replaced; the prior version remains in
  git history under its tag.

## 9. Phase 1–2 model (retained for reproducibility)

The `hark` simulator, superseded by §§1–5 but kept so the Phase 2 results
remain reproducible. Single-asset lifecycle consumption-saving with CRRA
utility, exponential discounting (β locked at 1), AR(1) labor income, no
illiquid assets, no credit cards. Annual, ages 20–90 (`T_cycle = 70`).

- Solver: HARK 0.17 `MarkovConsumerType` backward induction, with the default
  `IncShkDstn` and `MrkvArray` constructors overridden by closures reading our
  Rouwenhorst grid and transition matrix. Within Markov state `k` the
  transitory shock is degenerate at `exp(grid[k])` and the permanent shock at
  1; `PermGroFac = 1` throughout.
- Income: AR(1) in logs, `rho_y = 0.97`, `sigma_eps = 0.15`, `mu_y = 0.0`,
  Rouwenhorst with `n_income_states = 9`, initial state drawn from the chain's
  stationary distribution.
- Calibration: survival from HARK's bundled SSA 2020 period life table
